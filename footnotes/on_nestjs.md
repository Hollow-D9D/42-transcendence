can you please explain to me in plain English what the arguments of `@ManyToMany(() => Role, (role) => role.users)` mean? and why there are `=>` there

Certainly! The `@ManyToMany` decorator is used to define a many-to-many relationship between two entities in TypeORM. The decorator takes two arguments:

1. The first argument is a function that returns the target entity in the relationship. In this case, it returns the `Role` entity. The reason it's a function (using the arrow function syntax `() => Role`) is to avoid issues with circular dependencies between the related entities.

2. The second argument is a function that returns the inverse side of the relationship. In this case, it returns the `users` property of the `Role` entity. The arrow function `(role) => role.users` is a shorthand way to define a function that takes a `Role` object as input and returns its `users` property.

The arrow functions `() => Role` and `(role) => role.users` are used for two main reasons:

- To prevent issues with circular dependencies between the related entities, since the function is only evaluated when the relationship is actually used.
- To keep the code concise and more readable.

In plain English, `@ManyToMany(() => Role, (role) => role.users)` means: "This property represents a many-to-many relationship with the `Role` entity, and the inverse side of this relationship is the `users` property of the `Role` entity."
