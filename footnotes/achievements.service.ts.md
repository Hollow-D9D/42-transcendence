Can you explain to me in plain English what this code does?

```
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { InjectRepository } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
import { Repository } from 'typeorm';
import { Achievement, User } from 'src/typeorm';

@Injectable()
export class AchievementsService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(Achievement)
    private readonly achieveRepo: Repository<Achievement>,
    @InjectRepository(User) private readonly userRepo: Repository<User>,
  ) {
    this.seedAchiements();
  }

  achieves = [
    {
      name: '#1',
      icon: 'path/to/icon.png',
      description: 'The 1st one',
      level: 1,
      progress: 1,
    },
    {
      name: '#2',
      icon: 'path/to/icon.png',
      description: 'The 2st one',
      level: 1,
      progress: 1,
    },
  ];

  async getAchievements() {
    try {
      const achieves = await this.achieveRepo.find();
      return { achieves };
    } catch (error) {
      throw error;
    }
  }

  async seedAchiements() {
    try {
    //   await this.achieveRepo.clear();
      await Promise.all(
        this.achieves.map(async (achieve) => {
          const newOne = this.achieveRepo.create(achieve);
          await this.achieveRepo.save(newOne);
        }),
      );
    } catch (error) {
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

This code defines a service for managing achievements in a NestJS application with a TypeORM database. Let me break it down for you:

1. Import necessary modules and components: It imports the required modules from the NestJS framework, the TypeORM library, and the Achievement and User entities from the application.
2. Create a new class called AchievementsService and mark it as injectable: This allows other components in the application to use this service.
3. Define the class constructor: It takes two arguments, **`achieveRepo`** and **`userRepo`**, which are both instances of Repository for Achievement and User entities, respectively. It then calls the **`seedAchiements`** method.
4. Define the **`achieves`** array: This contains a list of achievements with their respective details (name, icon, description, level, and progress).
5. Define the **`getAchievements`** method: This method fetches all achievements from the database and returns them as an object with a property named 'achieves'.
6. Define the **`seedAchiements`** method: This method seeds the database with the achievements defined in the **`achieves`** array. For each achievement, it creates a new record and saves it to the database.

In plain English, this code defines a service to manage achievements in a web application. It allows you to fetch achievements from the database and seed the database with initial achievements.

---

can you describe the code of seedAchiements() method line by line please

---

Certainly! Here's a line-by-line explanation of the **`seedAchiements`** method:

1. **`async seedAchiements() {`**: This defines an asynchronous method called **`seedAchiements`**. The **`async`** keyword indicates that the method contains asynchronous operations using Promises.
2. **`try {`**: This starts a try block to handle any errors that might occur while executing the code inside it.
3. **`// await this.achieveRepo.clear();`**: This line is commented out, but if it were active, it would clear all the records in the **`achieveRepo`** (the achievement repository) before seeding new achievements.
4. **`await Promise.all(`**: This line starts an operation that waits for all promises inside the **`Promise.all()`** method to resolve. The **`await`** keyword is used to pause the execution until all promises are resolved.
5. **`this.achieves.map(async (achieve) => {`**: This line maps over the **`achieves`** array, and for each **`achieve`** object, it executes an asynchronous arrow function. The **`map`** function creates a new array of promises, one for each achievement in the **`achieves`** array.
6. **`const newOne = this.achieveRepo.create(achieve);`**: This line creates a new achievement record using the current **`achieve`** object from the **`achieves`** array. The new record is stored in the **`newOne`** variable.
7. **`await this.achieveRepo.save(newOne);`**: This line saves the newly created achievement record (**`newOne`**) to the database. The **`await`** keyword is used to pause the execution until the save operation is complete.
8. **`}),`**: This line closes the arrow function started in line 5 and the **`map`** function.
9. **`);`**: This line closes the **`Promise.all()`** function started in line 4.
10. **`} catch (error) {`**: This line starts a catch block to handle any errors that might have occurred during the execution of the try block.
11. **`throw error;`**: If there's an error, it rethrows the error, so it can be caught and handled by the calling function or a higher-level error handler.
12. **`}`**: This line closes the catch block.
13. **`}`**: This line closes the **`seedAchiements`** method.

In summary, the **`seedAchiements`** method seeds the database with initial achievements defined in the **`achieves`** array. It maps over the array, creating and saving each achievement record to the database. It uses a try-catch block to handle errors and leverages **`async/await`** and **`Promise.all()`** to handle asynchronous operations.

what would change if there were no `await` in front of `this.achieveRepo.save(newOne);` inside seedAchiements() method?

---

If there were no **`await`** in front of **`this.achieveRepo.save(newOne);`** inside the **`seedAchiements()`** method, the code would not wait for the **`save`** operation to complete before moving on to the next item in the **`achieves`** array. This could lead to the following issues:

1. **Concurrency issues**: Without waiting for the **`save`** operation to complete, multiple concurrent database operations might occur, which could cause potential conflicts or data integrity issues depending on the database being used and its configuration.
2. **Uncaught errors**: If an error occurs during the **`save`** operation, it won't be caught by the **`catch`** block because the Promise rejection would happen asynchronously after the **`try`** block has already finished execution. As a result, any error that occurs during the **`save`** operation might go unnoticed, and error handling won't work as expected.
3. **Unordered seeding**: Since the save operations are not awaited, they might complete in a different order than the order of items in the **`achieves`** array. This could lead to inconsistencies in the order of records in the database compared to the original array.

By using **`await`** in front of **`this.achieveRepo.save(newOne);`**, the code ensures that each save operation is completed before moving on to the next one, preserving the intended order of records, and allowing proper error handling.

You mentioned "promise rejection". What does it mean? Is it related anyhow to throwing errors?

---

A Promise rejection is a state of a Promise object when it has failed to fulfill its operation. In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

There are two main states a Promise can be in once it's settled:

1. **Fulfilled**: This means the asynchronous operation completed successfully, and the Promise has a resulting value.
2. **Rejected**: This means the asynchronous operation failed, and the Promise has a reason for the failure, typically represented by an error.

A Promise rejection is related to throwing errors because the reason for the rejection is often an error. When a Promise is rejected, it's generally due to an error being thrown inside the asynchronous operation, and this error is then propagated as the reason for the rejection.

You can handle Promise rejections using the **`.catch()`** method, which takes a function to be called if the Promise is rejected. When using **`async/await`**, you can handle rejected promises with a **`try-catch`** block. If you **`await`** a Promise inside a **`try`** block and it gets rejected, the error will be caught by the **`catch`** block.

In summary, a Promise rejection is a state where a Promise has failed to fulfill its operation, often due to an error. It is related to throwing errors because the reason for the rejection is typically an error, and you handle Promise rejections similarly to how you handle thrown errors in synchronous code.

what's the meaning behind `@InjectRepository(Achievement)` and `@InjectRepository(User)` in the class constructor signature?

---

**`@InjectRepository(Achievement)`** and **`@InjectRepository(User)`** are decorators in NestJS that indicate that the following parameters should be injected with instances of the TypeORM repositories for the **`Achievement`** and **`User`** entities, respectively.

In NestJS, a decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class, method, or property. Decorators use the form **`@expression`**, where **`expression`** must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.

In the case of **`@InjectRepository(Achievement)`** and **`@InjectRepository(User)`**, these decorators come from the **`@nestjs/typeorm`** package and are used to inject the appropriate TypeORM repository instances into the class constructor. These repositories are then used to perform database operations on the **`Achievement`** and **`User`** entities.

Here's a breakdown of the constructor signature:

```javascript
constructor(
  @InjectRepository(Achievement)
  private readonly achieveRepo: Repository<Achievement>,
  @InjectRepository(User) private readonly userRepo: Repository<User>,
)

```

The constructor has two parameters:

1. **`achieveRepo`**: This parameter is decorated with **`@InjectRepository(Achievement)`**, indicating that it should be injected with an instance of the **`Achievement`** repository. The parameter is also marked as **`private readonly`**, meaning it can only be accessed within the class and cannot be modified after initialization.
2. **`userRepo`**: This parameter is decorated with **`@InjectRepository(User)`**, indicating that it should be injected with an instance of the **`User`** repository. It is also marked as **`private readonly`** for the same reasons as the **`achieveRepo`**.

By using the **`@InjectRepository`** decorators, NestJS handles the dependency injection for you, making it easy to work with TypeORM repositories in your services.

---

How exactly do these decorators ensure that the parameters `achieveRepo` and `userRepo` are injected with instances of the TypeORM repositories for the Achievement and User entities? What's inside their (decorators') definition that ensures that?

---

The **`@InjectRepository`** decorator is part of the **`@nestjs/typeorm`** package, which provides a convenient way to integrate TypeORM with NestJS. The decorator is built on top of NestJS's dependency injection system, and it's designed to create and inject instances of TypeORM repositories for specified entities.

Under the hood, the **`@InjectRepository`** decorator is a higher-order function that creates a new decorator using NestJS's built-in **`@Inject`** decorator. It takes the entity class as an argument and generates a unique token based on the entity and the repository type. This token is used by NestJS's dependency injection system to associate the correct repository instance with the corresponding constructor parameter.

Here's a simplified example of how the **`@InjectRepository`** decorator might be implemented:

```javascript
import { Inject } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Repository } from 'typeorm';

export function InjectRepository(entity: Function, repositoryType: Function = Repository) {
  // Create a unique token based on the entity and the repository type.
  const repositoryToken = `${entity.name}${repositoryType.name}`;

  // Use the built-in @Inject decorator with the generated token.
  return Inject(repositoryToken);
}

```

When you use the **`@InjectRepository`** decorator in your class constructor, like in the following example:

```javascript
constructor(
  @InjectRepository(Achievement)
  private readonly achieveRepo: Repository<Achievement>,
  @InjectRepository(User) private readonly userRepo: Repository<User>,
) {}

```

The decorator generates unique tokens for the **`Achievement`** and **`User`** repositories and uses NestJS's **`@Inject`** decorator to request instances of the repositories based on these tokens.

To make this work, you also need to register the TypeORM repositories in your module by importing the **`TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Entity1, Entity2, ...])`** method. This method registers the repositories with the NestJS dependency injection system:

```javascript
@Module({
  imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Achievement, User])],
  providers: [AchievementsService],
  controllers: [AchievementsController],
})
export class AchievementsModule {}

```

In summary, the **`@InjectRepository`** decorator creates a unique token based on the provided entity and uses the built-in **`@Inject`** decorator to request the correct repository instance from the NestJS dependency injection system. To make this work, you need to register the repositories in your module by importing the **`TypeOrmModule.forFeature()`** method.

---

What would change if there were no `@InjectRepository(Achievement)` and `@InjectRepository(User)` in front of the constructor parameters?

---

If there were no **`@InjectRepository(Achievement)`** and **`@InjectRepository(User)`** decorators in front of the constructor parameters, NestJS's dependency injection system wouldn't know which instances of TypeORM repositories to inject into the constructor. This would lead to the following issues:

1. **Runtime errors**: When NestJS tries to instantiate the **`AchievementsService`** class, it will not know which dependencies to inject for the **`achieveRepo`** and **`userRepo`** constructor parameters, causing runtime errors due to missing dependencies.
2. **Dependency injection failure**: Without the **`@InjectRepository`** decorators, NestJS's dependency injection system will not be able to resolve the correct instances of the TypeORM repositories for the **`Achievement`** and **`User`** entities. As a result, you won't be able to use these repositories to perform database operations on the respective entities within the **`AchievementsService`**.

To fix these issues, you need to use the **`@InjectRepository`** decorators to explicitly specify the dependency injection for the **`Achievement`** and **`User`** repositories:

```javascript
constructor(
  @InjectRepository(Achievement)
  private readonly achieveRepo: Repository<Achievement>,
  @InjectRepository(User) private readonly userRepo: Repository<User>,
) {}

```

By adding the **`@InjectRepository`** decorators, you ensure that NestJS's dependency injection system knows which instances of TypeORM repositories to inject, allowing you to use them for database operations within the **`AchievementsService`** class.

"This token is used by NestJS's dependency injection system to associate the correct repository instance with the corresponding constructor parameter." -- could you elaborate on that please? It's not entirely clear

---

Sure, I'll elaborate on how NestJS's dependency injection system uses tokens to associate the correct repository instances with the corresponding constructor parameters.

In NestJS, the dependency injection (DI) system is responsible for managing and providing instances of dependencies to classes that need them, such as services or controllers. The DI system uses tokens to identify and differentiate between these dependencies.

A token is a unique identifier, often a string or a symbol, that is used as a key to register and look up dependencies in the DI system. When a class has a dependency, it uses a specific token to request the dependency from the DI system. The DI system then searches for the dependency associated with that token and provides the instance of the dependency.

In the case of **`@InjectRepository`**, the decorator generates a unique token based on the entity (e.g., **`Achievement`** or **`User`**) and the repository type (usually **`Repository`**). This token is passed to the built-in **`@Inject`** decorator, which tells the DI system to look for the corresponding TypeORM repository instance.

When you register the TypeORM repositories in your module using **`TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Entity1, Entity2, ...])`**, the DI system creates and associates instances of the repositories with the corresponding unique tokens generated by the **`@InjectRepository`** decorators.

Here's an example to illustrate this process:

1. In the **`AchievementsService`** constructor, you use the **`@InjectRepository(Achievement)`** decorator. The decorator generates a unique token for the **`Achievement`** repository.
2. The **`AchievementsModule`** imports the **`TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Achievement, User])`** method, which registers the **`Achievement`** and **`User`** repositories with the DI system and associates them with their respective tokens.
3. When the DI system instantiates the **`AchievementsService`** class, it sees the **`@InjectRepository(Achievement)`** decorator and looks up the **`Achievement`** repository instance associated with the generated token.
4. The DI system injects the **`Achievement`** repository instance into the **`AchievementsService`** constructor as the **`achieveRepo`** parameter.

This process is repeated for each **`@InjectRepository`** decorator and its corresponding entity. By using tokens, the NestJS DI system can manage and provide the correct instances of dependencies, such as TypeORM repositories, to the classes that need them.

---

You said

"When the DI system instantiates the AchievementsService class, it sees the @InjectRepository(Achievement) decorator and looks up the Achievement repository instance associated with the generated token."

Where exactly does it look up the Achievement repository instance?

---

When the NestJS dependency injection (DI) system looks up the **`Achievement`** repository instance, it searches for the instance within its internal container. The DI container is a data structure that stores and manages instances of dependencies registered with the DI system.

Here's a high-level overview of how the DI container works in the context of your example:

1. When you start your NestJS application, it creates and configures the DI container, which manages the instances of all registered dependencies in your application, including TypeORM repositories.
2. In the **`AchievementsModule`**, you register the **`Achievement`** and **`User`** repositories with the DI container by importing **`TypeOrmModule.forFeature([Achievement, User])`**. This tells the DI container to create and manage instances of the **`Achievement`** and **`User`** repositories.
3. When the DI container creates the instances of the **`Achievement`** and **`User`** repositories, it associates them with the unique tokens generated by the **`@InjectRepository`** decorators.
4. When the DI system instantiates the **`AchievementsService`** class, it encounters the **`@InjectRepository(Achievement)`** decorator, which tells the DI system to look up the instance associated with the **`Achievement`** repository token in the DI container.
5. The DI container finds the **`Achievement`** repository instance associated with the token and injects it into the **`AchievementsService`** constructor as the **`achieveRepo`** parameter.

The DI container serves as a central registry for all dependency instances in your application. When a class needs a dependency, the DI system looks up the instance within the container based on the token provided by the **`@Inject`** decorator or other custom decorators like **`@InjectRepository`**.
